# 🎉 Welcome to JoyScript! 🎉

> “A playground where JavaScript comes to life!”  

Hey there! I’m **Joyboy**, and this is **JoyScript** — my personal lab for experimenting, creating, and having fun with JavaScript.  

This repo is more than just code, it’s a journey. Each project here is a small adventure where logic meets creativity, where problems turn into interactive experiences, and where learning never feels boring.  

Here in JoyScript, you’ll find projects that make concepts pop, interactions come alive, and every click feels satisfying. Whether it’s a mini-game, a visual experiment, or a playful script, each piece is designed to **spark curiosity and joy**.  

I built this repo not just to learn, but to share a **world of playful code** that anyone (beginner or pro) can explore, enjoy, and get inspired by.  

So dive in, explore, and maybe even get inspired to build your own interactive magic.  

> ⚡ JoyScript isn’t just code. It’s curiosity turned into creativity.
